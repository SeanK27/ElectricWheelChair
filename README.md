# Electric Wheelchair Prototype

The Electric Wheelchair Prototype is a personal project to design a prototype of an electric wheelchair. This repository stores the control code for multiple device options.

## Devices

Code is written for the STM32F401 Nucleo and the Arduino R3. The controls are still under development.

## Contributions

Pull requests are welcome.
